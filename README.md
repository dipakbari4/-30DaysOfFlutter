## Day 1 of #30DaysOfFlutter

---

### Things I've done today
-  Went through the Dart Programming Language from Official Documentation and used [DartPad](https://dartpad.dev/) as a tool
-  Flutter uses Dart as its programming language. A tour of the Dart language is handy in this case. [Language Tour](https://dart.dev/guides/language/language-tour)
-  I had already installed the Flutter environment on my system. So, I skipped [this](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) step and moved ahead.
-  Created the First Project on Day 1 and modified the default counter app.

## Day 2 of #30DaysOfFlutter

---

### Things I've done today

-  Went through some of the very basic and fundamental topics on flutter and also checked about the [UI Widgets](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/widgets) from Official documentation.

-  I thought to create more complex than the previous one but kept patience üòÅ and created the Second Project on Day 2 and modified the default counter app [Very simple].

- Now, in this time I've used the local development environment only. But, it can be done on online also. Use [DartPad](https://dartpad.dev/) or [CodePen](http://codepen.io/) both are awesome online tools.
  
- I used the `Snackbar` widget too when the counter gets `value to 0`. Faced some difficulties because I was using it without `Scaffold` as its ancestor.
- I got this error while code `Scaffold.of() called with a context that does not contain a Scaffold.` and solved this issue from this [Resource](https://flutter.dev/docs/release/breaking-changes/scaffold-messenger)
- Finally, I've done what I wanted to do. üòä

## Day 3 of #30DaysOfFlutter

---

### Things I've done today

- Learned the way of switching `Layout`s from `appBar` using `IconButton`
- Today I used the `day_01` assets item to implement the dataSet `Flutter Family`
- I played with `ListView` and `GridView` and It was so fun to do this kinda stuff in Flutter. As Hot üî• reloads saves my lots of time.
- I also take [CodeLabs](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/first-flutter-app-pt2?hl=en#0) reference and used some code from there.
- I added `GridView` also to switch the view from `AppBar` action. Passed the `gridViewItem` custom.
- Added the functionality on `FloatingActionButton` to make it interactive and userful [Just Kidding üòÅ]. I know the validation aren't implemented in `TextFormField`. But It's perfect for me. üòä
- Using `AlertDialog` we can add new members too **Temporary only, there's no DB**.
- So far feeling good and happy to be able to develop whatever I wanted to do. It just really easy to learn, understand, and implmentand and I'm looking forward to learn more stuffs concisely and I'll try to add some documentation also. üòä

## Day 4 of #30DaysOfFlutter

---

### Things I've done today
- Made the item list using `List<String>.generate()` function and populated in `ListView` Widget.
- Wrapped the `ListView` widget with `Dismissible` widget to implement the remove item functionality.


---

## Day 5 of #30DaysOfFlutter

---

### Things I've done today
- **Flutter** is awesome to have a great look of User Interface Design and it allows us to directly implement the material design concept and their components.
- Today I planned to design a layout, based on [this](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/layout/tutorial) tutorial I designed a layout using `Rows`, `Columns`, and `Container` widgets etc.
- I also added mostly used widgets like `Image`, `Text`, and `Icon`


---

## Day 6 of #30DaysOfFlutter

---

### Things I've done today
- Today I worked specifically on String and It‚Äôs manipulation with the help of some commonly widgets like `TextFormField`, `Text`, `ElevatedButton` and Parent Widget Layouts like `Rows & Columns` and `Container`.
- The function is to swapping the first character of given string vice-versa using splitted string from it.
- Tried to replace the String's character according to their index value but couldn't make it in this approach then I done with `substring` function and made a separate function for it.


---

## Day 7 of #30DaysOfFlutter

---

### Things I've done today
- So far, I've done with `ListView`, `Image`, `Container`, `FloatingActionButton` widget and so on. Today is Sunday and I've planned to do revise the previous lessons and do some fun for refreshment.
- I went through the previous projects and decided to make a **Color Generator** app where `Color` will generate based on `Random` values.
- I implemented a `ListView` using `builder` method to add `ListTile` and the color information and sample gonna inside the `ListTile` as it's property / value.
- Used the `SizedBox` widget for getting box shaped stuff of `ListTile` leading and used `ListTile`'s `title` and `subtitle` as `Text`.
- When user will click on `FloatingActionButton` then the whole colors will change randomly.

## Day 8 of #30DaysOfFlutter

---

### Things I've done today
- Well, this is the first project of #Week2 and I thought It'd be better to start with using `Navigation` and started with it.
- This time I made six different apps based on`Navigation` / `Navigator` with different approaches.
- Coming from the Native Android Development I think almost everything which `Intent` class in `Java/Kotlin` can in **Flutter** it can be done by using `Navigation`.
