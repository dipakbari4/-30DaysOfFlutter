## app_1


app_1 an app that uses the basic `Navigation` system in Flutter. In this app, I implemented the `Navigator.push(context, route)` which allows us to have to another screen on current running application. For dismiss second screen I've used `Navigator.pop(context)`

Note: This example is taken from the official Flutter Documentation of [Navigation Part | Cookbook](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook/navigation/navigation-basics)
