# day_05

day_05 an app made to demonstrate how to design a layout using different kinds of `Value Widgets` and `Layout Widgets`.

**Widgets** mostly used to design this layout, includes (`Value Widgets`) => `ListView` , `Rows` , `Columns` , `Expanded` , and `Container` etc.

I used the `Value Widgets` like `Image` , `Icon` , and `Text`

**Note:** *There's no official documentation or convention about `Value Widgets` and `Layout Widget`. I kept these terms to making my own concept more comprehensive while designing layouts.*

**This layout design curriculum taken from the Official Site of Flutter Documentation.**

### Here's some of the screenshot of develop layout in Flutter
