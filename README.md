## Day 1 of #30DaysOfCode

---

### Things I've done today
-  Went through the Dart Programming Language from Official Documentation and used [DartPad](https://dartpad.dev/) as a tool
-  Flutter uses Dart as its programming language. A tour of the Dart language is handy in this case. [Language Tour](https://dart.dev/guides/language/language-tour)
-  I had already installed the Flutter environment on my system. So, I skipped [this](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) step and moved ahead.
-  Created the First Project on Day 1 and modified the default counter app.

## Day 2 of #30DaysOfCode

---

### Things I've done today

-  Went through some of the very basic and fundamental topics on flutter and also checked about the [UI Widgets](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/widgets) from Official documentation.

-  I thought to create more complex than the previous one but kept patience üòÅ and created the Second Project on Day 2 and modified the default counter app [Very simple].

- I used the `Snackbar` widget too when the counter gets `value to 0`. Faced some difficulties because I was using it without `Scaffold` as its ancestor.
- I got this error while code `Scaffold.of() called with a context that does not contain a Scaffold.` and solved this issue from this [Resource](https://flutter.dev/docs/release/breaking-changes/scaffold-messenger)
